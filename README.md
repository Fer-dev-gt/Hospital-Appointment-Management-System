<h1 align="center" id="title">UHospital. Appointments, medicine and prescriptions management system</h1>
<p>This üè• UHospital Simulator app üè• where a patient and doctor can interact by appointments is possible thanks to joining forces from two technologies creating and using an API from the backend and using the obtained data to modify of fronted using React to render our Components.

Uhostipal keeps all its records created by its user inside a couple of binary files where data is stored in JSON format so it can be easily obtained and used upon our frontend, you can create your own patient account a have access to different services UHospital has to offer like: making an appointement at any time, buy medicines for your prescription and see the receipts your doctors prescribed.

As a doctor or nurse you can manage all patients appointment request by rejecting them of accepting them and generete a proper prescription, the app will keep track of the medicines sold and all the appointments the doctors have finished.

There are more features and secrets inside this cool app, just try to find them all!  üë®üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è</p>

## Demo and Features
<p>As with almost everything in life we start with a simple login and register new user screen, if you already have an existing account the app will identify if your usertype is a patient, doctor or nurse. If you register a new user then your account will be a patient account by default</p>

<p>When you log in as a patient you will be displayed a menu with five buttons that show a different Component of the app to execute one of the following patient services, for example this one where a patient can ask for a doctor appointment by just submitting a date, hour and reason for the appointment </p>

<p>At any moment a patient can check the status of their appointment and see which doctor has been assigned, also if the appointment has been rejected by any reason</p>

<p>When a nurse logs in a new screen with different Components will be displayed, on this case the only function a nurse has is to assign a doctor to any pending appointment or reject it if there are no doctors available, when an appointment is being asigned a ComboBox will be displayed with all the doctors that have an active account</p>

## React Documentation
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

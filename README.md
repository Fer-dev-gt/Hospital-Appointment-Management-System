<h1 align="center" id="title">UHospital. Appointments, medicine and prescriptions management system</h1>
<p>This a simple but really interesting app, if you look under the code you will find 3 different way in which you can manage the state of your React Components, by using good old friend useState, this hook is really good and simple to learn but if you want to go back in time you can also find and study how to manage your State with Classes, that's right! You can even learn how to use Lifecycle methods like 'componentWillMount()' to manage any logic you want to execute. 

Finally you can be more elegant and make your code more scalable by managing your State with the last but not least important of the bunch, useReducer! This hook can be very powerful specially when you implemented action types and action creators so your code can be more readible!

So now you now that even if an app looks simple in the surface you can always learn new tricks when you read its code, enjoy!

Don't be shy and try it yourself, there are many surprises waiting for you!  </p>

## Demo and Features
<p>You can start by typing the word 'paradigma' (in lowercase) on the input then press the validate button</p>

<p>An 'artificial' loading message will appear in order to simulate any async code or api comsuption</p>

<p>If the word you wrote doesn't match with 'paradigma' (Remember it's in lowercase!) then an error message will appear</p>

<p>Once you match with 'password' the app will ask again if you are sure to 'delete' the State (just like Github when you want to do something dangerous ü§™)</p>

<p>If you clicked on 'Yes, delete' then the following window will appear confirming on the deletion of your State but, we give a change to go back to the initial state so you don't get fired üòé</p>

## React Documentation
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
